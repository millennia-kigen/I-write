**MILLENNIA JELAGAT KIGEN**










**ACKNOWLEDMENT**

I would solemnly like to acknowledge my supervisor, my classmates and my family who gave me all the support and guidance that I needed when carrying out this research.

**DECLARATION**

I solemnly declare that this is my honest work and is based on my creativity as a DSC student.














**CHAPTER 1**

**Statement Problem**

Every sentence, blog, article, advertisement, or post you read was written by a person who worked hard to create it. As digitization advances to new heights, content writing is emerging as a promising career path. Furthermore, being a novelist or essayist is not the only way to write content. With the advancement of technology, all information is literally at your fingertips. Everything you need to know is only a click away. That's when content writers come in handy, which explains why there's such a high demand for content writing jobs. 
Moreover, in order for that information to reach the millions of people who are searching for it, content writers are required. The Internet has evolved into the most effective means of communicating with people. As a result, almost all businesses require content to reach their target audience. The content writing scene has, however, lacked some crucial aspects that have somewhat crippled its full industrial potential. Currently, there is a deficiency gap that my system is expected to fill. Through my platform, the pedagogical gap between corporate companies and skilled writers will be filled.

**Study Justification**

This web-based application system will be the crucial determinant. The fact that the documents are linked to specific themes and topics is one of its distinguishing features. Businesses will pay a monthly or annual fee to gain access to a comprehensive archive of classified items for easy retrieval. Fees may be reduced or waived if they upload their content to the site. It is also expected to be one of many websites where businesses can pay for marketing assistance. This will provide a standard rating system that will be updated daily for companies to get intel on the writers' ideas which a bot will do.
Blog posts with high-quality content have been shown to attract more readers(Impulse, 2021). Writing a blog post or article is important because users want something complex and valuable rather than filled with superfluous material. Another distinguishing aspect of this developing website will be its fascinating algorithm for rewriting articles in similar text snippets. Because article writing is still the most popular type of SEO-focused content, there are thousands of articles on every known topic globally. This means that new material written on a particular topic will be difficult to come by. However, this is not to say that it is impossible to obtain new and unique content. Because the topic must be discussed hundreds of times, there is still a way to write my algorithm differently or approach. Combine that with new research and data that may not have been used previously, and you have a completely new paper with unique content on a popular topic.

**General objectives**

An internet-based system that enables individuals with writing aptitude to write, customers (corporate companies) to study, give feedback, up-vote, and down-vote, such that corporations in most need of adept writers will see the most highly regarded works and conceivably cooperate and employ them as frequently as needed.

**Specific objectives**

This system aims at not only providing a platform for writers and employers, but also foster young or rather any aspiring writer to learn how the writing scene works. In addition, through the platform, it will allow writers to post and share their work and also allow others to rate the work out of 10. It provides a supportive environment that aims at nurturing top notch commercial writing services at affordable rates. It aims at reducing unemployment since writing does not necessarily require a degree or a certificate.

**Abstract**

This system will allow all the users to have a personal account. The accounts will have an authentication for all the members including employers where they will be required to setup an email and a personalized password. The users will only have the choice of creating a writer account or an employer account. Both of which will have different dashboard setups. The criteria for writer ranking will be based on merit. The article with the highest number of votes will be the top most. Voting will also be authenticated to ensure no spam votes whatsoever and ensure a fair and legitimate poll. Employers will be awarded the power to get into contact with the writer depending on their membership status. Only verified members will be privileged in this case. The writers will also be granted an upper hand by being allowed to sell their articles. This will include an Escrow transaction controlled by the system to discourage scamming.  

**Limitations of the study**

This system is quite costly. The maintenance cost is quite an unavoidable aspect to be considered during the proposal. Managing a website is usually an easy task. However, as the number of users increase (it is expected to shoot upon completion) the need for tools such as google analytics and even employing system managers becomes a necessity to alleviate traffic online. The system fails to address some of the gaps it is intended to close since it will not be globally feasible geographically. It will be limited to Kenya due to facility declination predicament oof developing countries. 

**Scope of the study**

This research will involve and address the scrutiny, development and system implementation of an online platform where writers can showcase their creativity and be ranked based on merit and popularity thus allowing corporate firms to select and assimilate the best writers for their digital marketing and ecommerce ventures. The system’s implementation is aimed to begin in Kenya before crossing boundaries once it gains popularity. The study is based on the theorem that the internet and smartphones are the best resources for writers to get a solid platform. This study was limited to urban areas in Kenya where internet connectivity and electricity are easily accessible.
The system is going to incorporate html, CSS and Js for the front-end development and Laravel-php and SQL for the server and database end. Visual studio code will be pivotal for compiling and running of the code while Xampp will be used to create a local server to test the efficiency of the website. The system will only require a laptop or a desktop for deployment, development and implementation hence will be cost efficient. The study is limited to two semesters. The first semester is for writing the proposal and the latter for the development and implementation of the project.









**CHAPTER 2:  LITERATURE REVIEW**

**INTRODUCTION**

In the field of digital marketing, there exist various domains in which content serves a vital role in advertisement (Sachi East Africa, 2021).  Writing content for companies is a crucial component of marketing. Most digital advertising techniques revolve around content development. Information for direct marketing, social networking sites, blogs, as well as other forms of digital marketing campaigns too are key elements. Establishing influence on online platforms and online databases will be impossible sans writing material, and users already know how important such kinds of recommendations are in every business.
Recent research from Chan (2020) suggests that since the days of print advertising, content has gone a long way. Content has become the most effective technique to get a business into the digital sphere since the emergence of SEO and digital marketing. Content writing that is consistent and of high quality is indeed a useful tool for connecting brands with their customers.
Content Composing is an ability-based profession. There is no specific degree or course in the field of Content Composition. Not all authors have Writing Foundation. However, a four-year certification in Reporting, English or Mass Correspondence, are the prescribed degrees to turn into a Content Essayist. Individuals who have the specialty of offering their viewpoints in words can turn out to be acceptable substance authors. To turn into a viable content writer, you need to compose consistently. A creative writer compose content for sites, websites, articles, stories, paper articles, preparing modules, etc. A content author embraces their composing piece. As an author, dubiousness ought not be there in your composing pieces. With experience, you know how and where to alter, perceive and right normal slip-ups, syntactic mistakes, and compose clear depictions.
There are numerous career options that arise from content writing, they include:
Web content writers create content for use on the internet. As a web content writer, their responsibilities including writing about the firm, how it operates, products/services, blogs/articles, team member bios, client testimonials, email marketing, and so on. They will be asked to develop content that is web-friendly. As a writer, you must divide down information into short paragraphs, using headings if appropriate, bullet points, and highlighting key words and phrases. Web content writers are often freelancers; however, many companies do provide full-time positions. Such writers are the target users for this particular project.
The main target users expected to use the system are marketing content writers. They are required to develop and arrange content for newsletters, blogs, testimonials, email templates, corporate reports, and presentations, among other things, while juggling multiple content projects. They are required to contribute to the company's social channels (with a focus on Facebook, Instagram, Quora, Twitter, and LinkedIn), assist in the planning and implementation of social marketing campaigns for specific marketing objectives, and stay current on best practices in web writing, social media trends, web usability, web design, search engine optimization, and business/industry trends.
According to Finance (2020) content writing requires a niche. A niche is a specific topic about which a website creates content. To cultivate loyal readers, niches focus on a certain topic (Finance, 2020). A good website has material that visitors want to read again and again. Choosing a niche topic aids in the development of a topic-focused audience. People are aware that they can return to see things that they will enjoy. Most of the time, the writing platforms available on the market focus on one or two related niches. This system is proposed to contain multiple niches divided into related sections to facilitate a variety of fields from which numerous corporations to peruse the platform at once. Basically, a content mall.
Digital marketing, often known as online marketing, is the promotion of brands through the internet and other kinds of digital communication in order to engage with potential clients. As a business model, this comprises not only email, social media, and web-based advertising, but also content writing and multimedia messages (Mailchimp, 2021). Digital marketing is defined as any marketing campaign that uses digital communication.

**Global review**

  In the global scene, a few years back, content composition as a profession was not something individuals would consider as a standard alternative for their vocations. Indeed, even the curriculum framework recently envisioned it as a formal instructive course, however since reality as we know it has progressed immensely with the web, mindfulness for content composition as a vocation alternative has expanded massively on a global scale. As this has gone to be a significant mechanism for introducing data, practically all enterprises or organizations are firmly connected with content composition. This sets out a gigantic space and opens doors for content writers, where my system fits into the global writing scene. Every blog, article, post, diary, and even commercial is the consequence of somebody putting forth attempts to compose a coordinated piece of content. This platform is expected to fill the gap created by the surge of content deprivation in the digital marketing scene.
A career in content writing accompanies plenty of liabilities. First, one must have a reasonable comprehension of the profundities of composing and how the pursuers devour an assortment of content. Then, contingent on the abilities and experience, a vocation in content composing could be extremely smooth. Yet, there are chances when a content writing profession could be shaky because of an absence of vision and comprehension. 
There are various alternatives for individuals attempting to assemble their career in content writing (Mailchimp, 2021). This system will include each and one of them. Each professional niche in content composure necessitates an alternate arrangement of abilities and a comprehension of content composition. The fundamental prerequisite for one to seek a profession in content composing is communicating thoughts in words, a solid jargon, and an exhaustive comprehension of the language they will compose. Aside from these, capability in writing or news-casting would make it simpler to snatch openings rapidly. Yet, there is no such explicit interest in the capability of a profession in content composition. All these data were pivotal in the development of this system. 
An example of an international content writing website is the Writing Studio which is a content writing organization company that provides exceptional blogs' content, journals, website information, spec sheets, and other content types. They compose a wide spectrum of niches and are very popular for their outstanding specialized writing skills (Wagner, 2021). They are acknowledged for hiring exclusively the utmost dedicated and knowledgeable authors, and therefore take delight in giving a pleasant familiarity and results-oriented writing to their clientele. Through concepts from Writing Studio, the system to be developed will implement a sustainable service to all the prospective writers and organizations.
According to Digital (2019) digital marketing is a growing discipline globally. At this time, the world is increasingly digitized, as well as the increasing number of businesses around the globe include a digital viability (Digital, 2019). In the domain of advertisement and sales, digital marketing has been reported to have definitely played a vital role. Businesses can no longer adopt conventional marketing methods since digitalization is far more trustworthy & effective. Electronic commerce is much more cost-efficient, extra informative, and also increasingly efficient. Digital marketing offers effective methods for generating revenue while effectively raising the macroscopic scales to new heights (Kaushik, 2016).

**Regional literature review**

Africa has the lowest internet connectivity of any other continent, approximately Eighteen percent (Marketer, 2020).   Nevertheless, the above continent has been regarded as being in the same position as China a decade ago, and is now on the verge of a technological revolution. Africa, which is brimming with potential as well as innovations, ought not be overlooked by worldwide content writing brands. Comparing in contrast to several surrounding continents, Africa is endowed by a plethora of resources. Countless brilliant Africans have recently created trustworthy content writing platforms whereby individuals can acquire content writing support anytime they require it. Such sites offer excellent ideal writing solutions to clients from Africa as well as clientele from neighboring continents. Firms that need assistance will be able to communicate with expert content writers because the website is definitely among the most popular in Africa seeking creative writing assistance. All clients will be served by competent as well as possibly the best writers that ensure client contentment and prompt service, much like comparable recent leading organizations throughout Africa. They are expected to safeguard their customers' information and records so ensuring they will not be accessible to foreign entities. Whenever people presume of African content writing platforms, one often imagines flexibility and ease of writing assistance during any given point in time. Corporations that choose to subcontract their operations have reaped the perks of engaging online creatives.
As previously indicated, content writers on contract will be highly skilled with in disciplines inside which they specialize (Writers, 2019). This is advantageous because they are well-versed in managing tasks that have been allocated to them. Engaging with internet content writing professionals is ideal since they are quite adaptable. This is typically favorable considering users will be able to use these services whenever it is suitable for their business, increased performance. Companies will be capable of minimizing money as well as eliminate incurring unneeded charges by hiring professional writers. This is precisely since when individuals hire someone to manage a task, they simply pick up the tab for whatever is done and while they require it completed (Writers, 2019). This is advantageous since users will be effective in decreasing inconsistency, which will result in a loss of profitability due to expenditures that could be reduced. There's a whole plethora of reputable African content writing firms which are both effective as well as grant top tier assistance. Corporations around Africa have recognized the advantages of engaging utilization of content writing, which is why they prefer to do so rather than hire a comprehensive in-house staff who would add to company budgets.

**Local literature review**

Research from Mutanu (2017) found that most participants confirmed that online platforms boosted commercial penetration, provided accessibility to fresh marketplaces as well as clients, and nearly doubled the frequency of new subscribers to social platforms, according to the research. This is among the reasons why the system was developed to fill the existing gap in Kenya as demonstrated prior (Mutanu, 2017). Furthermore, the report's research results reveal that online platforms doubled the count of ad impressions, optimized marketing validation, and elevated client gratification. Blogs and websites were also found to have a substantial impact on SMEs' advertisement efficiency in the investigation. Online platforms accounted for 20.6 percent of SMEs' business performance, according to the statistics (Mutanu, 2017). This comprehensive analysis exposes a professional loophole for which content writers can utilize their skills to help SME’s and other corporations boost their digital insights.
Kenya is still a growing economy. Throughout Kenya, operating a modest company can sometimes be complicated. In comparison to many other sections of the region, economic intricacies appear unique (MarketGuru, 2021). Nevertheless, it is clear that an unprecedented number of Kenyans are turning to the internet seeking additional assistance. For Kenya, this thus gives a really significant opportunity for digital marketing and as a result a prospective rise in professional content writing demand (MarketGuru, 2021).
Content merchandising isn't a brand-new idea. Corporations have been utilizing content marketing since 1672, according to statistics. Nonetheless, as internet marketing has grown in popularity over the last 20 years, content marketing has become increasingly prevalent. Content marketing may indeed be described as making utilization of non-aggrandizement content such as articles, video, visualizations, and other forms of content to promote an organization, commodities, and offering service providers. One can't necessarily opt to simply market their goods to individuals via the web, especially as it is quickly emerging into more of a social arena. Marketing provides visitors with excellent content concerning a specific specialty that they might consider beneficial.
In the property market in Kenya, for illustration, content creation might enable a business to diversify their product line. Rather than constantly urging their readers to acquire property or perhaps a residence, developers from content writing websites such as the one in development may produce a blogging post about "Some Procedures One Should Consider While Purchasing Property in Kenya."

This really is fundamentally the goal of digital marketing (MarketGuru, 2021). As users establish legitimacy in their niche, this technique can assist them generate loyalty amongst their readership. Instead of just continually marketing company items, through the platform writers can instead provide material that is indeed extremely detrimental as well as pertinent to their audience, such as recommendations and comments to their issues (MarketGuru, 2021).

**Conclusion**

To sum up, the global, regional and local digital marketing scene show immense potential for content writers to fill in the professional gap. This system aims to do exactly that and improve content quality as well as provide a viable platform for struggling writers from Kenya and later increase the scope to a global scale.








**CHAPTER 3: SYSTEM METHDOLOGY**

The system will be developed using a full stack developmental procedure and compiled using Visual Studio Code for the front and back end. The system will be tested by a local host application (preferably Xampp).
Methods used in development was the top- down economy. This was because top-down framework helps a software analyst determine overarching corporate goals upfront, and also how they can be effectively addressed in a complex network. The designer subsequently breaks down the program into modules including the associated needs. This approach was feasibly compatible with the system under construction both economically and time efficiently.
This top-down strategy additionally places a greater focus around synchronicity, and the relationships between frameworks and modules necessitate, wherein the bottom-up methodology does not. It contributes to the understanding of how individuals should therefore collaborate in order to achieve respective objectives.
Minimizing sheer complexity of constructing a platform simultaneously is among the benefits of utilizing a top-down paradigm to systems configuration. Designing and deploying service delivery internet platforms, as observed, is extremely difficult. Merely trying to have all modules fully operational at the same time is admitting defeat (w3computing.com, 2017).

**Registration process**

The top-down approach allows the programmer to begin creating user authentication controls, the database to store the user login data (using SQL) and encrypt the passwords of the platform users. The users are categorized into writers and audience whereby the audience is divided into two (individuals and Corporations) (w3computing.com, 2017).
The system will also include two step factor authentication to ensure user validity and security of accounts. This will be included in the registration process as a necessity to be verified fully as a member of the content writing community. Once the users are done with the personal information registration, they will be redirected to a billing system that will provide various subscription packages for the various audiences. Writers will be exempted from the subscription but will have to submit authentic written samples that will be graded and verified (w3computing.com, 2017). 

**User Interface**

Upon account creation, user interfaces will vary for the three subsets. This will be done by HTML, CSS and Js integration. Each of the interfaces will vary according to the goals of the users (writer, individual and corporation).
TOOLS
•	HTML, CSS & Js for the front-end
•	Xampp, Laravel-php and SQL for the back-end
•	Visual studio Code for the coding environment
•	Chrome for testing the website

**Coding**

As stated earlier the coding will be completely full-stack oriented. The integration of variables and functions will alleviate processes in the system such as saving content, editing content, liking and commenting on brilliant and creative content posted on the website timeline.

**Accounts Flowchart**

These pictorial representations reflect on the chronological flow of data and instruction in the operation of the system once it is fully implemented. These flowcharts also assist the system administrator to find and eliminate any errors.
Login flowchart
Here the user enters their correct login credentials. If the system doesn’t recognize the user, it prompts a registration instance for the user. Furthermore, if either of the credentials are wrong the system allows two more entries before authenticating a recovery procedure for the user to follow. This will include phone number or email verification and immediate password change.
Figure.1 

**Testing**

Despite the fact that system test is a vital element of web design, some programmers overlook it. The issue is that the likelihood of a defect occurring grows between each cycle of coding, and the expense of resolving bugs doubles over latency. This hardly, though, is necessary with thorough website testing. Here as, when the program testing goes well, the application will be ready to be deployed.

**Functionality Testing**

The primary stage in the test process is to ensure that the website works properly. Functional testing examines the SQL statement, all hyperlinks on website pages, analytics, and interfaces included to input and/or obtain information from users, among other things. These were implemented initially in the development procedure to hasten up the entire website-development process as well as to lessen concerns as the loop progressed. It leads back to completing a list of functions that must be completed either remotely through the use of application or interactively via a sentient testing.

**Usability Testing**
Usability assessment will be the next stage. This sort of testing integrates the functional testing discussed above alongside the holistic client interaction. It differs from Client Approval testing except that the objectives are varied, so too are the phases of web design and during that such data is collected and analyzed. Independent evaluators who imitate a target client base can be hired, or domestic assessment could be conducted by the programmers directly. If developers desire to conduct exogenous testing but aren't sure how to start, programs such as Apple's TestFlight can certainly assist.


**CHAPTER 4: SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS**

**Functional requirements** 
•	User Registration Page
•	Log In Page Username And Password
•	Instances Of Users Forgetting Password 
•	Two-step Factor authentication
•	Email and Phone Number Verification 

Functional requirements;
Notify the writers when they get engagements in their posts
Notify audience users when new articles are available for review and rating




















**CHAPTER 5: WORK PLAN AND BUDGET**

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the website is expected to be implemented and developed smoothly with all the factors in place. The Content writing scene in Kenya is still evolving and this website is expected to utilize the opportunity fully and provide a life changing platform for young, creative and innovative writers to unleash their potential and help improve digital marketing as a discipline. Digital marketing is a revolutionary IT field with prospective capabilities.

**Recommendation**

 It is highly recommended that more resources and attention be drawn to content writing and its detrimental effects on digital marketing in Kenya.
